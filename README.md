# ImmersiveLanguage
Virtual Reality project

Prototype of Virtual Reality (VR) application which aims to make learning a language efficient and fun. The prototype presents a multi-user virtual environment where language students represented as virtual avatars, can communicate in a foreign language whilst a teacher observes, gives instructions and feedback.

Players are wearing (Google cardboard) headsets and can use the built-in microphone of their smartphone. When players are looking around head movement and rotation is actually visible to the other player. Also, when a player talks, the other player will see the lips of his avatar move.

In this prototype only one scene and two players are implemented.

Technologies: Unity3D, C#, Google Cardboard, VoIP
